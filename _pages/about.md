This is the personal web page of Dr Robin Corey, a computational biophysicist interested in membrane proteins and how they are affected by their lipid environment. 

Undergraduate and postgraduate research
======
I got my undergraduate BSc in Biochemistry from the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/). Here I worked for two terms in the lab of [Professor Neil C Bruce](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/research/plant-biology/neil-c-bruce) on a cytochrome P450 which breaks down the explosive RDX.

I then carried out a MSc and PhD at the [University of Bristol](https://bristol.ac.uk/biochemistry/), working in the lab of [Professor Ian Collinson](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Ian-Collinson-0cde2e1b-6fb7-4a0a-9ae8-34ee83d80d6a/). Here, I used a range of experimental techniques (including functional assays, FRET, X-ray crystallography, SEC-MALS, and non-natural amino acid substitution) as well as computational methods (including molecular dynamics, molecular modelling, and free energy calculations) to determine the mechanism of protein-secretion in bacteria via SecYEG.A, a key component of bacterial virulence and a promising target for antibiotics. We have now published a series of papers on this topic, combining both experimental and computationl analyses. This includes work on how ATP binding and hydrolysis drives protein secretion via a Brownian ratchet (published in [four](https://elifesciences.org/articles/15598), [separate](https://elifesciences.org/articles/41803), [_eLife_](https://elifesciences.org/articles/35112), [papers](https://elifesciences.org/articles/47402) ), and how the membrane proton motive force also contributes to this (manuscript in preparation). In addition, we have studied how the SecY translocon is "unlocked" by pre-protein (published in [_Structure_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969212616000460), and how the phospholipid cardiolipin bindings and functionally-modulates SecYEG (published in [_PNAS_](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/31/7967.short)).

Postodoctoral research
======
I have worked at the [University of Oxford](https://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/) as a postdoc in the labs of [Professor Mark Sansom](https://www.bioch.ox.ac.uk/research/sansom) and [Dr Phillip Stansfeld](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/lifesci/people/pstansfeld/) since 2018. See the Stansfeld Research website [here](https://stansfeldresearchgroup.wordpress.com/).

Here, I have used both atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics to understand how membrane proteins move and interact with the surrounding membrane. I have worked with a number of different bacterial membrane proteins, including ABC transporters (e.g. [WzMT](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-08646-8)), outer membrane beta-barrels (e.g. [LptDE](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-00694-2)), small molecule transporters (e.g. [LeuT](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ange.201914411)), P-type ATPases (e.g. [KdpFABC](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25242-x)), and ion channels (e.g. [KimA](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14441-7)). In addition, I have looked at how 42 different _E. coli_ membrane proteins interact with cardiolipin, allowing us to [propose rules for a bacterial cardiolipin binding site](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abh2217).
